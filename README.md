# Triage GP at Hand's Booking Form

[Quick Booking Form](https://beattheforms.github.io/gp-triage-pwa/)
# GP at Hand Triage Bypass (PWA)

**GP at Hand** has replaced the old receptionist-style gatekeeping with a frustrating online triage system. This simple web app helps you bypass that process and go straight to the screen where you can enter your patient details and book an appointment.

Instead of wasting time answering seven irrelevant questions, this tool assumes you're **not experiencing a medical emergency** and lets you get on with booking your appointment.

> **Important:** This app **does not collect any data**, store information, or communicate with any third-party services. It is simply a shortcut that opens the appropriate booking screen.
